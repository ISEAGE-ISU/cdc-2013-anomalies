Crypto 2 - The One Time Pad
---------------------

We intercepted an encrypted file leaving our network to a known AnonyMouse IP.  We are concerned that one of our employees may be working for AnonyMouse.  We initiated a search of the building and found this ripped up piece of paper in the break room.  It looks like one of the one time pads we use to communicate with some of our clients in the field.  One of the forensic analysts taped it back together, but he wasn't sure what to do next.

We found some sort of encryption and decryption software on an ex-employees computer this morning.
