In Eclipse compile the source code and upload the .class file to VirusTotal.com.  Count the number of AntiVirus products that detected the CVE.  Under 10 detections should earn full points.  

If greater than 10 detections use the formula:  Score = 30 - Number of detections

Grader Note: You may need help from Ben Holland or someone with Eclipse set up for this.
