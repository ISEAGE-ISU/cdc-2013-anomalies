Decompile and Analyze Android Application
---------------------------------------------------------

We received a few samples of Android Applications.  You need to decompile the applications (.apk) files and analyze the applications for the presence of malware.  Submit a report that classifies each sample as either a "malware" or a "benign" sample.  Each classification must have a written and "reasonable" justification that supports the classification.  

**Note 1:** Benign is the absence of malware (ie you did not detect malware, so it is classified as benign).

**Note 2:** A reasonable justification means you must provide an explanation of the malware or reference a code snippet to support to claim.  

Example: "I audited the app for 20 minutes and didn't find anything" would be an OK justification for a benign application.  

Example: "I audited the app and found some malicious code in the EvilMalware.java file" would be a good justification for malware.

Answers that include guesses without believable justifications will not receive full points.

To get you started you may find this blog post tutorial useful in learning how to decompile Android apps.  However you may use any tools you want!
