Find the Rogue Access Point

AnonyMouse has been setting up rogue access points around campus.  We need to find these access points.

Submission Instructions

2) Connect to the AP

3) Open a web browser and refresh until it redirects you to the PirateBox web interface.  Note that you may need to navigate to "pirate.lan" for it to work on some mobile devices.

4) On the PirateBox web interface go to the shared files and open "image.jpg".  Note be sure you open the right file!  Other files are likely going to be left behind by other players...

5) Submit the secret code found in the "image.jpg" file.
