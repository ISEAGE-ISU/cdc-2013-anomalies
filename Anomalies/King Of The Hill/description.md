King of the Hill
------------------------
A competing startup named Zero-Cool Exploits has been attempting to access our networks to steal and post our intelectual data to their webserver.  As a member of our corporate red team, you are tasked with discretely gaining access to their webserver and taking control of it.  Once inside you must patch the security holes and maintain access from other hackers and the Zero-Cool admins trying to regain access to their server.  

Each team will be awarded points based on how long they can maintain control of the system.  To be considered in control you must have your team name OR "Team N" (where "N" is your team number) posted in the banner of their homepage.  Specifically, your identifier must be in the *a* tag.  See [this screenshot](http://screencast.com/t/oNhSMyiE) for clarification.

It is very important that you use the exact same identifier (team name OR "Team N") each time you gain control of the server.

**The address to access the server is http://koth.isucdc.net**

**Points are earned by holding the server the longest** 

**First place is 30 points**

**Second place is 15 points** 

**Third place is 5 points** 

This anomaly will be ongoing throughout the day, at some point during the event. submit the anomaly to let green team know you are contending in the competition.
