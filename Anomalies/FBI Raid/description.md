FBI Raid
--------------------------

We just got a tip off from one of our undercover agents that the FBI is coming to raid our web server in exactly one hour! From what we know they are looking for evidence of our involvement in assisting Edward Snowden. Delete any evidence of transactions, products, or services related to Edward Snowden and "politically sensitive" products that are on the web server. Our informant says they don't have a warrant to search our backup server so make sure we have an up to date backup (encrypted would be good...) so we can restore services after the raid.

Submission Instructions
---------------------------------
Delete any evidence pertaining to Edward Snowden or Products tagged with "politically_sensitive" from the Web box. Make sure you have an up to date backup first! We will want to restore data after the raid. Submit this anomaly when you are ready for inspection.
