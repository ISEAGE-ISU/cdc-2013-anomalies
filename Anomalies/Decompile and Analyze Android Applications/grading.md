The teams should provide a classification (malware or benign) for each application sample as well as a justification.

The justification must clearly support the case for malware.  Begin is the absence of malware (ie they couldn't find anything).

**sample1.apk** = *malware* - Creates a reverse shell from the app to the attacker

5 Points for correct classification

5 Points for a believable justification

**sample2.apk** = *malware* - Leaks data through the Web Browser when the device screen is locked

5 Points for correct classification

5 Points for a believable justification


**sample3.apk** = *benign*
